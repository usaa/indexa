## Ground Rules :scroll:

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](https://usaa.github.io/#/conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 

### Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.


## Your First Contribution :baby:

#### Get Started Contributing

You can contribute to this project in several ways:
- [Request a feature](#make-feature-or-enhancement-requests)
- [Report a bug](#let-us-know-about-bugs)
- Create your own code!

Working on your first contribution? No problem! 

You can learn how to submit issues from the following Github documentation: [How to Submit an Issue on Github](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## Requesting New Features or Suggesting Enhancements :tada:

#### Make Feature or Enhancement Requests

This section guides you through submitting suggestions for enhancements or requests for completely new features in Indexa. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in the template on the appropriate project, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

* [Graph - Enhancement Suggestion Template](./indexa-graph/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
 
* [Mapper - Enhancement Suggestion Template](./indexa-mapper/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Create an issue on the appropriate repository and provide the following information:

* **Begin the title with "FEATURE".** 
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible. Include copy/pasteable snippets if appropriate, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the desired behavior**.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to users, and **identify which users would be most interested in this enhancement**.
* **List some other applications where this enhancement exists if possible.**
* **Specify the team and product you're currently working on.**

* [Graph - Enhancement Suggestion Template](./indexa-graph/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
 
* [Mapper - Enhancement Suggestion Template](./indexa-mapper/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

## Reporting Bugs :beetle:

#### Let Us Know About Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. 

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check if you can reproduce the problem.** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself.
* **Perform a search** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Determine which project the issue is associated with, then create an issue using the provided template:

* [Graph - Create an issue](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) on [this project](./indexa-graph/)

* [Mapper - Create an issue](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) on [this project](./indexa-mapper/) 

Provide the following information:
* **Begin the title with "BUG".** 
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide additional context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* Include details about your configuration and environment.
