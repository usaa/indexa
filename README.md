Hello, and welcome to the Indexa!

# What is the Indexa?

The Indexa is a group of projects that work together to analyze and provide dependency data for developers, regarding the dependencies needed by any project which gathers dependencies from a single directory. The Indexa analyzes artifact data (data on jars, wars, and ears) and outputs lucene index data to detail the analysis results, specifically regarding what an artifact uses and which artifacts it is used by.

## Official Project Documentation 

All documentation can be found in [Hitchhiker's Guide to The Indexa.](./docs/index.md) 

Happy coding!
